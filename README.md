# ConvLSTM
 Convolutional LSTM in Pytorch  
 Learning some craftsmanship from https://github.com/ndrplz/ConvLSTM_pytorch  
 This idea has been proposed in this paper: [Convolutional LSTM Network: A Machine Learning Approach for Precipitation Nowcasting]    (https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5955-convolutional-lstm-network-a-machine-learning-approach-for-precipitation-nowcasting.pdf)
